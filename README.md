# -Enhancing-RL-Poker-using-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Techniques
Poker has been considered a challenging problem in both artificial intelligence and games. Designing an effective optimal policy learning method has more realistic significance. This research project extensively explores and compares the efficacy of diverse reinforcement learning algorithms in training intelligent agents for Texas  Hold'em poker.
"Enhancing RL Poker using Deep Reinforcement Learning Techniques" refers to the process of improving a poker-playing agent's performance by employing advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Here's a breakdown of what this entails:

Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward. It involves:

Agent: The learner or decision maker.
Environment: Everything the agent interacts with.
Actions: The set of all possible moves the agent can make.
Rewards: Feedback from the environment used to assess the success of actions.
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
Deep Reinforcement Learning combines RL with deep learning. In DRL, neural networks are used to approximate the functions that map states of the environment to the best actions the agent should take. This allows for handling complex, high-dimensional environments.

Application to Poker
Poker is a challenging game for AI due to its elements of chance, incomplete information, and the need for strategic thinking. Enhancing a poker agent using DRL techniques involves:

State Representation:

Using neural networks to represent the game state, including cards, bets, and previous actions.
Action Selection:

The agent uses its learned policy to decide whether to fold, call, or raise based on the current state.
Reward System:

The agent receives rewards based on the outcomes of its actions, such as winning a hand or making profitable bets.
Training:

The agent is trained through simulations of poker games. It learns to improve its strategy over time by playing against itself or other agents.
Exploration vs. Exploitation:

The agent balances exploring new strategies and exploiting known successful strategies to maximize its overall performance.
Techniques in DRL for Poker
Several DRL techniques can be used to enhance poker agents:

Deep Q-Networks (DQN): Uses neural networks to approximate Q-values, which represent the expected rewards of actions.
Policy Gradient Methods: Directly optimize the policy by following the gradient of expected reward.
Actor-Critic Methods: Combine value-based and policy-based approaches, where the actor updates the policy and the critic evaluates it.
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Enhances decision-making by simulating future actions and rewards.
Goals and Benefits
The goal of using DRL in poker is to create agents that can:

Adapt to different opponents and strategies.
Make optimal decisions under uncertainty.
Continuously improve through self-play and learning from past games.
The benefits of this approach include more sophisticated and competitive poker agents, capable of challenging human players and providing insights into strategic decision-making in uncertain environments.
